    Corrade::Containers::Reference
        — a lightweight alternative to std::reference_wrapper

    https://doc.magnum.graphics/corrade/classCorrade_1_1Containers_1_1Reference.html

    This is a single-header library generated from the Corrade project. With
    the goal being easy integration, it's deliberately free of all comments
    to keep the file size small. More info, detailed changelogs and docs here:

    The STL compatibility bits are included as well --- opt-in by specifying
    `#define CORRADE_REFERENCE_STL_COMPATIBILITY` before including the file.
    Including it multiple times with different macros defined works too.
