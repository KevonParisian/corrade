    Corrade::Containers::StridedArrayView
        — multidimensional strided array view

    https://doc.magnum.graphics/corrade/classCorrade_1_1Containers_1_1StridedArrayView.html

    Depends on CorradeArrayView.h.

    This is a single-header library generated from the Corrade project. With
    the goal being easy integration, it's deliberately free of all comments
    to keep the file size small. More info, detailed changelogs and docs here:

    v2020.06-1454-gfc3b7 (2023-08-27)
    -   New expanded() and collapsed() APIs
    -   Ability to slice to struct members and member functions
    -   New exceptPrefix() API, the except() API is renamed to exceptSuffix().
        The suffix() API, which took an offset, is removed and will be
        eventually reintroduced again but taking suffix size, consistently with
        prefix() that takes prefix size.
    -   New sliceSize() API, taking a begin + size instead of begin + end
    -   New stridedArrayView() convenience helpers for creating 1D strided
        array views from ArrayView instances and a pointer + size
    -   The Size and Stride member typedefs are moved to the Containers
        namespace; Size1D, Size2D, Size3D, Size4D, Stride1D, Stride2D,
        Stride3D and Stride4D convenience typedefs were added
    -   Renamed empty() to isEmpty() for consistency with other bool-returning
        APIs
    -   MSVC 2022 compatibility
    -   Removed dependency on <utility>, resulting in about ~600 preprocessed
        lines less
    v2020.06-0-g61d1b58c (2020-06-27)
    -   Added mutable StridedDimensions::begin()/end()
    -   New cross-dimension arrayCast() overloads
    -   Added isContiguous() and asContiguous() overloads
    -   Similarly to ArrayView, there's now a StridedArrayView<void> and
        StridedArrayView<const void> specialization usable for type-erased
        storage in constexpr contexts
    v2019.10-0-g162d6a7d (2019-10-24)
    -   Don't assert when creating arrays with non-zero stride but zero size
    -   Added a StridedArrayView4D convenience typedef
    v2019.01-301-gefe8d740 (2019-08-05)
    -   MSVC 2019 compatibility
    -   New constructor taking just a size, with stride calculated implicitly
    -   Added except() for taking everything except last N elements
    -   Added every() for taking every Nth element
    v2019.01-173-ge663b49c (2019-04-30)
    -   Initial release
