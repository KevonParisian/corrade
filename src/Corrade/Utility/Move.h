Swaps two values. Equivalent to @ref std::swap(), but without the

@m_class{m-doc-external} [std::move()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/move),
hurting debug performance. In order to keep supporting custom specializations,
the usage pattern should be similar to the standard utility, i.e. with
@cpp using Utility::swap @ce:

@snippet Utility.cpp swap

@partialsupport On @ref CORRADE_MSVC2015_COMPATIBILITY "MSVC 2015" it's just an
    alias to @ref std::swap(), as compiler limitations prevent creating an
    alternative that wouldn't conflict.

/* The common_type is to prevent ambiguity with (also unrestricted) std::swap.
   See MoveTest::swapStlTypesAdlAmbiguity() and swapUtilityTypesAdlAmbiguity()
   for details. Besides resolving ambiguity, in practice it means that
   std::swap() will get preferred over this overload in all cases where ADL
   finds it due to a STL type being used. Which means potentially slightly
   worse debug perf than if this overload was used for those too, due to
   libstdc++, libc++ and MSVC STL all delegating to move() instead of inlining
   it. */
